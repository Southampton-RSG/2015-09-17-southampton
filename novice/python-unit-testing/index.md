title: Writing Robust Code and Unit Testing
---

Does the code developed by you work the way it should do? Can you (or others) verify these assertions for themselves? And perhaps most importantly, to what extent are you confident of the accuracy of results that appear in publications? This session will teach you techniques of developing robust code and good unit tests to improve the predictability of a change, make development more productive and produce code that works as expected and produces desired results.
