<p>
If you haven't already, please register for free accounts to 
<ul>
<li>Make use of Github. Register <a href='https://github.com/'>here</a> and don't forget your password. We will use this service as part of the lesson on version control.</li>

<h3>2. Take a look at Python</h3>

<p>
If you are new to Python, or you fear that your Python is rusty, it 
may be worth taking a look at an online introduction. Christopher 
Woods has a nice short introduction 
<a href='http://chryswoods.com/beginning_python'>here</a>. 
If you can follow this as 
far as "conditions", you are good to go. We will be reviewing this 
material anyway, so don't worry if you get stuck.
