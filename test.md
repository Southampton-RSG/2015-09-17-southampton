## Topics

*  ...

NB: try to split up big lessons into separate topics, around 10-20 mins
each. This makes it much easier to follow for both instructor and 
participant.

## Other Resources

these are also written in markdown and converted into HTML, just like
this page. The first one uses the 'slides' layout to generate presentable
slides - see motivation.md)
