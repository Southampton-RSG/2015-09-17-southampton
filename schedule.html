<h2>Schedule</h2>

<p>
  The following is an outline of what will be taught in the course. Additional notes on the teaching materials will be available shortly before the course and during the course.
</p>

<p>
 <strong>Session 1: Building programs with Python </strong> <br/>
 <em>Sunday 21 June, 10:30 AM - 12:00 Noon</em><br/>

 In this session, you'll learn good programming practices with an introduction to fundamentals of Python, how to design and build programs more efficiently and the tools
 and techniques that you can adopt to produce better code.
 
 Following topics will be covered:

 <ul>
      <li>Using libraries</li>
      <li>Working with arrays</li>
      <li>Reading and plotting data</li>
      <li>Creating and using functions</li>
      <li>Loops and conditionals: <code>for</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, ...</li>
      <li>Defensive programming</li>
      <li>Using Python from the command line</li>

 </ul>

</p>

<br/> <br/>

<p>
 <strong>Session 2: Version control with Git</strong> <br/>
 <em>Sunday 21 June, 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM </em><br/>

 This session will teach you how to solve problems when you are a part of research team sharing code, methods to keep track of multiple versions of the same code or retrieve
 modifications in source code and an easier way to backup your work via an insight into version control system called Git.

 Following topics will be covered:

  <ul>
      <li>Creating a repository</li>
      <li>Recording changes to files: <code>add</code>, <code>commit</code>, ...</li>
      <li>Viewing changes: <code>status</code>, <code>diff</code>, ...</li>
      <li>Ignoring files</li>
      <li>Working on the web: <code>clone</code>, <code>pull</code>, <code>push</code>, ...</li>
      <li>Resolving conflicts</li>
      <li>Open licenses</li>
      <li>Where to host work, and why</li>

  </ul>  
</p>

<br/> <br/>

<p>
 <strong>Session 3: Unit testing</strong> <br/>
 <em>Sunday 21 June, 3:00 PM - 4:30 PM </em><br/>

 Does the code developed by you work? Always? Does it do what you think it does? Does it continue to work even after changes are made? Does it continue to work after system 
 configurations or libraries are upgraded? Does it respond properly for full range of input parameters and edge cases? How will it affect your publications? <br/>

 This session will teach you concepts and techniques of writing good unit test to reduce complexity of your software, improve the predictability of a change, make 
 development faster and produce a clean code that works as expected and produces desired results. You'll learn these skills through a Python unit testing framework called 
 Nose. Following topics will be covered:

 <ul>
   <li>Introduction to Nose testing framework</li>
   <li>Writing and executing unit tests</li>
   <li>Defensive programming</li>
   <li>Test-Driven development</li>
   <li><a href="novice/python/05-defensive.html">Reference...</a></li>
 </ul>
</p>
