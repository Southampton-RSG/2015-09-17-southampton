<p>If we want to see what we changed when, we use <code>git diff</code> again, but refer to old versions using the notation <code>HEAD~1</code>, <code>HEAD~2</code>, and so on:</p>

<p>In this way, we build up a chain of revisions. The most recent end of the chain is referred to as <code>HEAD</code>; we can refer to previous revisions using the <code>~</code> notation, so <code>HEAD~1</code> (pronounced &quot;head minus one&quot;) means &quot;the previous revision&quot;, while <code>HEAD~123</code> goes back 123 revisions from where we are now.</p>
<p>We can also refer to revisions using those long strings of digits and letters that <code>git log</code> displays. These are unique IDs for the changes, and &quot;unique&quot; really does mean unique: every change to any set of files on any machine has a unique 40-character identifier. Our first commit was given the ID f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b, so let's try this:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> diff f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b mars.txt</code></pre>

<p>That's the right answer, but typing random 40-character strings is annoying, so Git lets us use just the first few:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> diff f22b25e mars.txt</code></pre>

<p>All right: we can save changes to files and see what we've changed---how can we restore older versions of things? Let's suppose we accidentally overwrite our file:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">nano</span> mars.txt
$ <span class="kw">cat</span> mars.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>We will need to manufacture our own oxygen</code></pre>
<p><code>git status</code> now tells us that the file has been changed, but those changes haven't been staged:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code># On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
#   (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)
#
#   modified:   mars.txt
#
no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We can put things back the way they were by using <code>git checkout</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> checkout HEAD mars.txt
$ <span class="kw">cat</span> mars.txt</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity</code></pre>
<p>As you might guess from its name, <code>git checkout</code> checks out (i.e., restores) an old version of a file. In this case, we're telling Git that we want to recover the version of the file recorded in <code>HEAD</code>, which is the last saved revision. If we want to go back even further, we can use a revision identifier instead:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> checkout f22b25e mars.txt</code></pre>
<p>It's important to remember that we must use the revision number that identifies the state of the repository <em>before</em> the change we're trying to undo. A common mistake is to use the revision number of the commit in which we made the change we're trying to get rid of. In the example below, we want retrieve the state from before the most recent commit (<code>HEAD~1</code>), which is revision <code>f22b25e</code>:</p>

<p>The following diagram illustrates what the history of a file might look like (moving back from <code>HEAD</code>, the most recently committed version):</p>

<p>If you read the output of <code>git status</code> carefully, you'll see that it includes this hint:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">(use</span> <span class="st">&quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot;</span> to discard changes in working directory<span class="kw">)</span></code></pre>
<p>As it says, <code>git checkout</code> without a version identifier restores files to the state saved in <code>HEAD</code>. The double dash <code>--</code> is needed to separate the names of the files being recovered from the command itself: without it, Git would try to use the name of the file as the revision identifier.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The fact that files can be reverted one by one tends to change the way people organize their work. If everything is in one large document, it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion. If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files, on the other hand, moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.</p>
