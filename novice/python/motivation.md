title: Building programs with Python	
subtitle: Why Python?

## Why Python?

- This introduction to Python is built around an end to end scientific example: data analysis
- Goal is to teach basic programming concepts that all programming depends on

## Motivation

- It's free, well-documented, and runs almost everywhere
- Large (and growing) user base among researchers and scientists
- Easier for beginners to grasp 

## Python Introduction	

- Interpreted, dynamically typed, object-oriented very high-level language, compiles to bytecode
- Close to pseudocode, indentation marks block structure
- Popular for application development on its own
- Used as scripting language in many applications and games
     + Gimp
     + Battlefield2
     + ...
     
## Basics: Variables, types and Data Structures

- Introduction to Python variables
- Creating and assigning values to variables
- Types: Built-in types and type handling
     + Built-in: String, integers, boolean and floating point
     + type(val) returns the type of a variable (also classes)  
     + int(val[,base]) converts to an integer (of base base)
     + float(val): Corresponding to floats
     + str(val): Corresponding to strings (classes allow this automatically)
      
## Lists in Python

-  Lists as arrays
-  Indexing and Slicing      
      
## Using Python libraries

-  What is a library (module) and its usage
-  Reading data from a file
-  Numpy arrays and operations on arrays of data
-  Selecting individual values and subsections of data
-  Plotting data using `matplotlib` library

## Control Flow: Repeating actions with loops

-  What a loop does?
-  Writing loops accurately to repeat simple calculations
-  Trace changes to a loop variable as the loop runs
-  Trace changes to other variables as they are updated by a `for` loop

## Control Flow: Making choices

-  Write conditional statements including `if`, `elif` and `else` 
-  Correctly evaluate expressions containing `and` and `or`

## Creating Functions

-  Defining a function, the parameters that it takes, return value
-  Test and debug a function
-  Scope of variables
-  Set default values for function parameters
-  Divide programs into small, single-purpose functions

## Command-line Programs

-  Using values of command-line arguments in a program
-  Handling flags and files separately in a command-line program
-  Reading data from standard input in a program
