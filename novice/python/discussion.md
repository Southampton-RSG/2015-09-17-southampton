## Rules of Debugging

1.  Fail early, fail often.
2.  Always initialize from data.
3.  Know what it's supposed to do.
4.  Make it fail every time.
5.  Make it fail fast.
6.  Change one thing at a time, for a reason.
7.  Keep track of what we've done.
8.  Be humble.
9.  Test the simple things first.

And remember,
a week of hard work can sometimes save you an hour of thought.
