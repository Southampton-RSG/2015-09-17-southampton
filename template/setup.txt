Set up infrastructure for using lesson template
-----------------------------------------------

1. Copy the contents of this directory into your lesson directory,
   i.e. into novice/lesson-name

2. Install each of the prerequisites in requirements.txt using easy_install, e.g.
   $ sudo easy_install pandocfilters


Typical process for developing materials
----------------------------------------

1. Modify the index.md and 01-intro.md markdown files, adding your own
   topic files in the form of nn-topic.md, and linking to the *HTML* versions
   of those files (i.e. nn-topic.html) from index.md in the 'topics' section

2. Type 'make clean' to remove the existing HTML files. This will also 
   remove all .pyc files and those that end with ~ in their filename.

3. Type 'make check' to check your markdown against Software Carpentry style
   guidelines (these are only recommendations)

4. Type 'make preview' to generate HTML files from all the markdown .md files
   in the directory. You can view the generated HTML files directly (i.e. as
   files) in your browser without having to upload them to GitHub first.
   Note that this will not work on any markdown files in any subdirectories,
   only those in the directory with the Makefile.

5. When you are happy with the local versions of the generated HTML files,
   add/commit all changed files into your local repository e.g.
   $ add .
   $ commit -m "A helpful message about what was changed/added" .

6. Push those changes back to the public repository
   $ git push

7. Check the uploaded HTML files in a browser, e.g. point browser to
   http://softwaresaved.github.io/<repo>/novice/<lesson-name>/index.html
