<h2>Schedule</h2>

<p>The following is an outline of what will be taught in the course. Additional notes on the teaching materials will be available shortly before the course and during the course.

<p>
 <strong>Session 1: Building programs with Python </strong> <br/>
 <em>Sunday 21 June, 10:30 AM - 12:00 Noon</em><br/>

In this session, you'll learn good programming practices with an introduction to the fundamentals of Python, how to design and build programs more productively and the tools and techniques that you can adopt to produce better code.
 
The following topics will be covered:

 <ul>
      <li>Using libraries</li>
      <li>Working with arrays</li>
      <li>Reading and plotting data</li>
      <li>Creating and using functions</li>
      <li>Loops and conditionals: <code>for</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, ...</li>
      <li>Defensive programming</li>
      <li>Using Python from the command line</li>

 <strong>Session 2: Version control with Git</strong> <br/>
 <em>Sunday 21 June, 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM </em><br/>

This session will teach you how to solve problems when you are a part of research team sharing code, as well as methods to keep track of multiple versions of the same code, and an easier way to backup your work all illustrated through the Git version control system.

The following topics will be covered:

  <ul>
      <li>Creating a repository</li>
      <li>Recording changes to files: <code>add</code>, <code>commit</code>, ...</li>
      <li>Viewing changes: <code>status</code>, <code>diff</code>, ...</li>
      <li>Ignoring files</li>
      <li>Working with remote repositories, e.g. through GitHub: <code>clone</code>, <code>pull</code>, <code>push</code>, ...</li>
      <li>Resolving conflicts</li>
      <li>Open licenses</li>
      <li>Where to host work, and why</li>

 <strong>Session 3: Unit testing</strong> <br/>
 <em>Sunday 21 June, 3:00 PM - 4:30 PM </em><br/>

Does the code developed by you work the way it should do? Can you (or others) verify these assertions for themselves? And perhaps most importantly, to what extent are you confident of the accuracy of results that appear in publications?<br/>

This session will teach you concepts and techniques of writing good unit test to reduce complexity of your software, improve the predictability of a change, make development more productive and produce code that works as expected and produces desired results. You'll learn these skills through a Python unit testing framework called Nose.

The following topics will be covered:

 <ul>
   <li>Introduction to Nose testing framework</li>
   <li>Writing and executing unit tests</li>
   <li>Defensive programming</li>
   <li>Test-Driven development</li>
