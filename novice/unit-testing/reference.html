<ul>
<li>Program defensively, i.e., assume that errors are going to arise, and write code to detect them when they do.</li>
<li>Put assertions in programs to check their state as they run, and to help readers understand how those programs are supposed to work.</li>
<li>Use preconditions to check that the inputs to a function are safe to use.</li>
<li>Use postconditions to check that the output from a function is safe to use.</li>
<li>Write tests before writing code in order to help determine exactly what that code is supposed to do.</li>
<li>Know what code is supposed to do <em>before</em> trying to debug it.</li>
<li>Make it fail every time.</li>
<li>Make it fail fast.</li>
<li>Change one thing at a time, and for a reason.</li>
<li>Keep track of what you’ve done.</li>
<li>Be humble.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="errors-and-exceptions"><a href="07-errors.html">Errors and Exceptions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Tracebacks can look intimidating, but they give us a lot of useful information about what went wrong in our program, including where the error occurred and what type of error it was.</li>
<li>An error having to do with the “grammar” or syntax of the program is called a <code>SyntaxError</code>. If the issue has to do with how the code is indented, then it will be called an <code>IndentationError</code>.</li>
<li>A <code>NameError</code> will occur if you use a variable that has not been defined (either because you meant to use quotes around a string, you forgot to define the variable, or you just made a typo).</li>
<li>Containers like lists and dictionaries will generate errors if you try to access items in them that do not exist. For lists, this type of error is called an <code>IndexError</code>; for dictionaries, it is called a <code>KeyError</code>.</li>
<li>Trying to read a file that does not exist will give you an <code>IOError</code>. Trying to read a file that is open for writing, or writing to a file that is open for reading, will also give you an <code>IOError</code>.</li>
</ul>
