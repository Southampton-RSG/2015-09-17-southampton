  INTRODUCTION
  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.

<p align="justify">
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers get more research done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.  This hands-on workshop will cover basic
  concepts and tools, including building and designing programs in Python, 
  managing the development of code with version control in Git, and testing 
  the correctness of Python code using the Nose unit test framework. Participants will be encouraged to help one another.
