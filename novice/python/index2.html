<h2>title: Programming with Python</h2>

<p>The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful,
so this introduction to Python is built around a common scientific task:
data analysis.</p>

<p>Our real goal isn't to teach you Python,
but to teach you the basic concepts that all programming depends on.
We use Python in our lessons because:</p>

<ol>
<li>we have to use <em>something</em> for examples;</li>
<li>it's free, well-documented, and runs almost everywhere;</li>
<li>it has a large (and growing) user base among scientists; and</li>
<li>experience shows that it's easier for novices to pick up than most other languages.</li>
</ol>

<p>But the two most important things are
to use whatever language your colleagues are using,
so that you can share you work with them easily,
and to use that language <em>well</em>.</p>
