## Python Introduction	

- Interpreted, dynamically typed, object-oriented very high-level language, compiles to bytecode
- Close to pseudocode, indentation marks block structure
- Popular for application development on its own
- Used as scripting language in many applications and games
     + Gimp
     + Battlefield2
     + ...
     
## Basics: Variables, types and Data Structures

- Introduction to Python variables
- Creating and assigning values to variables
- Types: Built-in types and type handling
     + Built-in: String, integers, boolean and floating point
     + int(val[,base]) converts to an integer (of base base)
     + float(val): Corresponding to floats
     + str(val): Corresponding to strings (classes allow this automatically)
     + type(x) returns the type of a variable (also classes)   
- Multiple assignment is possible

## Data Structures in Python

-  Python has built-in support for data structures such as lists, dictionaries, tuples and sets.
      + Lists: can be used as lists, arrays, stacks and queues.
      + Dictionaries: associative memories (i.e. hash tables)
      + Tuples:
